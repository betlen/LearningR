## Renaming
# Rename all columns to snake case

## The pipe operator

# without the pipe operator
colnames(nhanes_small)

# Pipe operator: Ctrl + Shift + M

## Filtering
# Filter for all females

# Participants who are not female
nhanes_small %>%
    filter(sex != "female")

# Participants who have BMI equal to 25
nhanes_small %>%
    filter(bmi == 25)

# Participants who have BMI greater or equal to 25
nhanes_small %>%
    filter(bmi >= 25)

# BMI is greater than 25 AND sex is female
nhanes_small %>%
    filter(bmi > 25 & sex == "female")

# BMI is greater than 25 OR sex is female
nhanes_small %>%
    filter(bmi > 25 | sex == "female")


## Arranging data
# Arranging by age in ascending order
nhanes_small %>%
    arrange(age)

# Arrange by sex in ascending order
nhanes_small %>%
    arrange(sex)

# Arranging by age in descending order
nhanes_small %>%
    arrange(desc(age))

# Arranging by sex then age in ascending order
nhanes_small %>%
    arrange(sex, age)

# Arranging by sex descending then age in ascending order
nhanes_small %>%
    arrange(desc(sex), age)


## Transform or add columns
# Transform height values to metres
nhanes_small %>%
    mutate(height = height / 100)

# Add a new column with logged height values
nhanes_small %>%
    mutate(logged_height = log(height))

# Transform height values to metres and add log column
nhanes_small %>%
    mutate(height = height / 100,
           logged_height = log(height))

# New column based on how active participants are
nhanes_small %>%
    mutate(highly_active = if_else(phys_active_days >= 5,
                                   "Yes", "No"))
